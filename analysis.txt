1. Explain the purpose of EC2PrimeDeployRole and why it needs S3 permissions.
    EC2PrimeDeployRole is an IAM role that allows EC2 instance to perform needed actions during deployment. CodeDeploy stores applications in S3 bucket. EC2 then gets permission to download the artifacts from S3 during deployment.

2. How does appspec.yml ensure the application runs after deployment?
    Appspec.yml defines lifecycle hooks that dictate how an application is deployed on an EC2 instance. It makes sure the application runs by defining hooks, using ApplicationStart hook, and ensuring service persistence.

3. If the EC2 instance were in a private subnet, what changes would be needed for CodeDeploy to work?
    In a private subnet, EC2 would not be able to directly access AWS services like S3 or CodeDeploy by the Internet. In order to enable deployment, you would need to enable private connectivity, allow outbound communication, and ensure proper security group and route table configurations.
